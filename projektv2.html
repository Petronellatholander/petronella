        I have created an innovative app design that promotes the recycling and
        reuse of secondhand perfumes. Through this project, as an innovation
        service, I have focused on quickly going from idea to product in just
        two weeks. My app design aims to enable users to sell the perfumes they
        no longer use, reducing waste and promoting sustainability. Through the
        app, users can easily list their perfumes for sale and browse through
        available products. I have likely included features that allow user
        reviews, payment integration, and searching for specific perfumes. My
        project is an excellent example of how rapid innovation services can
        realize creative ideas and address important societal issues like
        sustainability. By minimizing the time from idea to product, I have
        demonstrated how innovation can occur quickly and efficiently in this
        environment. My app design has the potential to promote a culture of
        recycling and reduce waste in the beauty industry.
